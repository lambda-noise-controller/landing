      <h2>Noise Controller Features</h2>

      <p>Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…0
        I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Bender?! You stole the atom.
        Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. I can explain. It's very valuable. File not found. We're rescuing ya. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
       <br/>
       <p>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. But existing is basically all I do! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</p>


      <h2>How Noise Controller Can Help Keep the Peace</h2>
       <p>I've opened a door here that I regret. Michael! Really? Did nothing cancel? Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer.
          <br/>
          <p>I'm half machine. I'm a monster. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. I've opened a door here that I regret.
          What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. Marry me. Steve Holt!  Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. Guy's a pro. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?
          Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. I care deeply for nature. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. Michael!</p>
          <br/>
          <ul>

            <li>No… but I'd like to be asked! I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. Michael! Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!</li>

            <li>It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. I'm afraid I just blue myself. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. I've opened a door here that I regret.</li>

            <li>What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun.</li>
