        Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single?
        It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! I'm just glad
        my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Goodbye, cruel world.
        Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would
        appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom
        curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… I love this planet! I've
        got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things
        bring. Bender?! You stole the atom. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical
        violence never solved anything. I can explain. It's very valuable. File
        not found. We're rescuing ya. I daresay that Fry has discovered the
        smelliest object in the known universe! Alright, let's mafia things up a
        bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. We need rest. The
        spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. But existing is
        basically all I do! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest
        object in the known universe!

    <h2>How Noise Controller Can Help Keep the Peace</h2>
      
      <p>
        I've opened a door here that I regret. Michael! Really? Did nothing
        cancel? Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Bad news. Andy
        Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        I'm half machine. I'm a monster. There's so many poorly chosen words in
        that sentence. I've opened a door here that I regret. What's Spanish for
        "I know you speak English?" First place chick is hot, but has an
        attitude, doesn't date magicians. Marry me. Steve Holt! Say goodbye to
        these, because it's the last time! It's called 'taking advantage.' It's
        what gets you ahead in life. Guy's a pro. But I bought a yearbook ad
        from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? Get me a vodka rocks. And
        a piece of toast. I care deeply for nature. Did you enjoy your meal,
        Mom? You drank it fast enough. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down.
        He didn't like his trailer. Michael!
      </p>
      <br />

      <ul>
        
          <li>No… but I'd like to be asked! I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.</li>
          <li>Michael! Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!</li>
          <li>That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.</li> 
        </ul> 
          <br/>
          
          <p>Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us
          down. He didn't like his trailer. I've opened a door here that I
          regret.</p>
            <br/>
          <p>What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" Say goodbye to these,
          because it's the last time! Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Now, when
          you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more
          fun.</p>
